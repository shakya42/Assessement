                                Module 1: Introduction to Statistics

## Question 1

There is an assumption that there is no significant difference between boys and girls with respect to intelligence. 
Tests are conducted on two groups and the following are the observations.

| Group | Mean | Standard Deviation | Size |
|-------|------|---------------------|------|
| Girls | 89   | 4                   | 50   |
| Boys  | 82   | 9                   | 120  |


Validate the claim with 5% LoS (Level of Significance).

### Solution:

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Data for girls
mean_girls = 89
std_girls = 4
n_girls = 50

# Data for boys
mean_boys = 82
std_boys = 9
n_boys = 120

# Calculate the t-value
t_value = (mean_girls - mean_boys) / np.sqrt((std_girls**2 / n_girls) + (std_boys**2 / n_boys))
df = n_girls + n_boys - 2  # degrees of freedom
p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.t.cdf(np.abs(t_value), df))  # two-tailed p-value

print(f"t-value: {t_value:.2f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Conclusion
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: There is a significant difference between boys and girls with respect to intelligence.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: There is no significant difference between boys and girls with respect to intelligence.")




## Question 2

Analyze the below data and tell whether you can conclude that smoking causes cancer or not?

| Category       | Diagnosed as Cancer | Without Cancer | Total |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Smokers        | 220                 | 230            | 450   |
| Non-Smokers    | 350                 | 640            | 990   |
| **Total**      | 680                 | 910            | 1590  |

### Solution:

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Observed data
observed = np.array([[220, 230], [350, 640]])

# Chi-square test
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(observed)

print(f"Chi-square value: {chi2:.2f}")
print(f"p-value: {p:.4f}")

# Conclusion
if p < 0.05:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between smoking and cancer.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between smoking and cancer.")
