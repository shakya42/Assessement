                                                                  ASSESSMENT 1 

1. Import pandas and read in the banklist.csv file into a dataframe called banks.
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL//Desktop/banklist.csv")
print(Banks)

2. Show the head of the Dataframe.
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Dell/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
print(banks.head())

3. What are the column names?
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
print(banks.columns)

4. How many States (ST) are represented in this data set?
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
print(banks["ST"].nunique())

5. Get a list or array of all the states in the data set.
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
x = banks["ST"].unique()
print(x)

6. What are the top 5 states with the most failed banks?
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
x = banks.groupby("ST").size()
y = x.sort_values(ascending = False)
z = y.head(5)
print(f'The top 5 failed banks : {z}')

7. What are the top 5 acquiring institutions?
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
x = banks.groupby("Acquiring Institution").size()
y = x.sort_values(ascending = False)
z = y.head(5)
print(z)

8. How many banks has the State Bank of Texas acquired? How many of them were actually in Texas?
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
x = banks[banks["Acquiring Institution"] == "State Bank of Texas"]
y = x.shape[0]
z = x[x["ST"] == "TX"].shape[0]
print(f'Total no of banks acquired by State Bank of Texas : {y} Banks')
print(f'No of banks actually in Texas is : {z}')

9. What is the most common city in California for a bank to fail in?
import pandas as pd
banks = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DATASETS/banklist.csv")
x = banks[banks["ST"]=="CA"]
y = x["City"].value_counts().idxmax()
z = x["City"].value_counts().max()
print(f'The most common city in California for a bank to fail in is: {y}')
print(f'Number of failures in this city: {z}')
